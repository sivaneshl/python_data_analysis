# creating a boolean mask - a boolean mask is a series (1D) or data frame (2D) where the values are either True or False
# we can create a boolean mask for a data frame for the list of countries that have a Gold
print(df['Gold'] > 0)

# overlay that mask on the data frame -  using the where function
# The where function takes a Boolean mask as a condition, applies it to the data frame or series, and returns a new
# data frame or series of the same shape
# Apply this Boolean mask to our Olympics data and create a data frame of only those countries who have won a gold at a
# summer games
only_gold = df.where(df['Gold'] > 0)

# We see that the resulting data frame keeps the original indexed values, and only data from countries that met the
# condition are retained. All of the countries which did not meet the condition have NaN data instead. This is okay.
# Most statistical functions built into the data frame object ignore values of NaN.
# For instance, if we call the df.count on the only gold data frame, we see that there are 100 countries which have had
# gold medals awarded at the summer games, while if we call count on the original data frame, we see that there are 147
# countries total.
